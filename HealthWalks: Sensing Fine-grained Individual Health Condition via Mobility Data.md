`Abstract`

Can health conditions be inferred from an individial's mobility pattern? Existing research has discussed the realtionship between individual physical activity/mobility and well-being, yet no systematic study has been done to `investigate the predictability of fine-grained health conditions from mobility`, largely due to the unavailability of data and unsatisfactory modeling techniques. Here, we present a large-scale longitudinal study, where we collect the health conditions of 747 individuals who visit a hospital and tracked their mobility for 2 months in Beijing, China. To facilitate fine-grained individual health condition sensing, we propose HealthWalks, an interpretable machine learning model that takes use location traces, the associated points of interest, and user social demographics as input, at the core of which a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) is proposed to auto-generate explainable features to capture useful signals. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, which achieves 40.29% in Marco-f1 and 31.79% in Macro-F1 for the 8-class disease category prediction, and outperforms the best baseline by 22.84% in Micro-F1 and 31.79% in Maco-F1.

 

### 3 Data Collection, Preliminary Analysis and Task Formulation

#### 3.1 Data Collection

We collect a real-world mobility trace along with use improvement demographics and medical data, which combine the raw mobility records with the points of interest (POI) data enrich the semantics of the trajectory.

#### 3.3 Task Formulation

`Definition 3.1(Urban Mobility UMR)`

An urban mobility record is a quaternion $(u,l,t,d)$, which denotes that user $u$ visits location $l$ at time $t$ and stays at that location for duration $d$, where $l$ denotes a unique area with geographical coordinates (i.e. longitude and latitude) and boundary in the urban space.

`Definition 3.2(Point of Interest, POI)`

在我们的模型中，每一个位置$l$都对应有一个POI向量，代表该位置$l$周围的POI分布.

`HealthWalks Target.`

Given the mobility records of users with the associated POI distribution data, we aim at predicting the potential health risks for each user based on the mobility metrics automatically generated by a deterministic finite automation. The derived mobility metrics should not only be able to enhanced the performance of the prediction task, but also to preserve fine-grained interpretability that can explain the health signals reflected by the mobility trace.

### Method

Here we balance the two key factors, accuracy and interpretability, and propose a model based on deterministic finite automata, to automatically generate numerous interpretable features.

#### 4.1 Definitions of Metrics

Before formally introducing the main structure of our model, we should first give the definitions of the notations and mobility metrics utilized in our model.

`4.1.1 Mobility Metrics `

- The number of different locations visited $N_d$. This metric $N_{d_u}$ is defined as the total number of unique locations visited by user $u$.
- Maximum distance $D_m$.

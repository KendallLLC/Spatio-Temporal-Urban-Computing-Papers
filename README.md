# Spatio-Temporal-Urban-Computing-Papers
My research interests related papers, including Spatio-Temporal Forecasting, GCN, GAN and other state-of-the-art methods.

Every week, new papers are coming out and it's hard to track of them all, not to mention the incredibly creative ways in which researcher naming their models. Here is a list of the latest articles I've read and categorized.

## Urban Flow/Traffic/Speed Prediction papers presented in Top Conferences (AAAI, NeurlPS, IJCAI, ICML, KDD, etc).
1. DeepSTN+: [Context-aware Spatial-Temporal Neural Network for Crowd Flow Prediction in Metropolis(AAAI-19)](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/3892)
2. 
3. STSGCN [Spatial-Temporal Synchronous Graph Convolutional Networks: A New Framework for Spatial-Temporal Network Data Forecasting](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/AAAI/article/view/5438)
